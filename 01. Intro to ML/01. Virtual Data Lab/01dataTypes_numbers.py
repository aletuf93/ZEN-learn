# Basic Arithmetic
# %%Addition
2+1

# %%Subtraction
2-1

# %%Multiplication
2*2


# %%Division
3/2

# %%Powers
2**3

# %%Can also do roots this way
4**0.5

# %%Order of Operations followed in Python
2 + 10 * 10 + 3

# %% Can use parenthesis to specify orders
(2+10) * (10+3)


# %%  Variable Assignments


# Let's create an object called "a" and assign it the number 5
a = 5
a+a

# %% Reassignment
a = 10

# Check
a


# %% overwrite

# Check
a

# Use A to redefine A
a = a + a

# Check
a


# %% The names you use when creating these labels need to follow a few rules:
#
#     1. Names can not start with a number.
#     2. There can be no spaces in the name, use _ instead.
#     3. Can't use any of these symbols :'",<>/?|\()!@#$%^&*~-+
#     3. It's considered best practice (PEP8) that the names are lowercase.
#
# Using variable names can be a very useful way to keep track of different
# variables in Python. For example:


# %%
#Exercise define variables and formulas to calcualate
#1 area of a circe
#2 perimeter of a circle
#3 the quantity of ingredients to buy, given a number of people to feed
